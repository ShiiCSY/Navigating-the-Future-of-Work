<h1>Objective</h1>
We are putting ourselves in the role of students preparing to enter the workforce.

In today’s rapidly changing job market, we face several key challenges:
	•	Acquiring the right mix of skills to stay competitive
	•	Identifying industries, roles, and locations that align with our career aspirations

Given these challenges, it is important to find a well-paying career path that offers strong growth potential and is less likely to be replaced by AI.

Our goal: Empower new graduates to make strategic career choices by leveraging insights into roles, skills, industries, and locations that best match their aspirations.


<h1>Visualization Insights (Business Intelligence)</h1>
**1.Filtering Target Jobs**
<br>We filter jobs based on three criteria: low automation risk, above-average salaries, and high growth potential. This step identifies roles that align with our career goals and narrows down industries and job types for further analysis.

**2.Required Skills for Target Jobs**
<br>By analyzing the skills needed for jobs identified in the first story point, we can pinpoint in-demand skills across industries. This insight helps us focus on developing the capabilities required for high-potential roles.

**3.Job Search Strategies**
<br>To improve our job search, we explore variables such as company size, location, industry, and remote-work compatibility. This analysis helps us understand where and how to focus our efforts to find jobs that meet our criteria.
