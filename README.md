<h1>Objective</h1>
We are putting ourselves in the role of students preparing to enter the workforce.

In today’s rapidly changing job market, we face several key challenges:
	•	Acquiring the right mix of skills to stay competitive
	•	Identifying industries, roles, and locations that align with our career aspirations

Given these challenges, it is important to find a well-paying career path that offers strong growth potential and is less likely to be replaced by AI.

Our goal: Empower new graduates to make strategic career choices by leveraging insights into roles, skills, industries, and locations that best match their aspirations.
